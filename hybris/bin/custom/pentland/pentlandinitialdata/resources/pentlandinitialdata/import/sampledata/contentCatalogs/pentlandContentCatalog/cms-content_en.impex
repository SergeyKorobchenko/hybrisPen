<li><strong> Our Contract</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>2.1. No order will be binding upon the Company unless and until accepted by the Company in writing or by delivery of any goods the subject of the order (&ldquo;Goods&rdquo;).</p>
<p>2.2. Orders are accepted only on the basis that these Terms (or varied as aforesaid) apply to the order. Accordingly any terms endorsed on or contained or referred to in any customer&rsquo;s order or confirmation or otherwise communicated to the Company which are inconsistent with these Terms and are not specifically agreed to in writing by the Company, shall be deemed to be superseded and nullified by these Terms.</p>
<p>2.3. The Company reserves the right to amend any accidental error or omission on quotations, order acknowledgements, invoices or credit notes.</p>
<p>2.4. Although all delivery dates stated by the Company are given in good faith and all reasonable efforts will be made to adhere to them, the Company accepts no liability for any failure to comply with such dates by reason of any cause beyond the Company&rsquo;s reasonable control. Time of delivery shall not be of the essence.</p>
<p>2.5. The Company shall be entitled to make partial deliveries and failure to deliver part only of any order shall not entitle the customer to reject the Goods.</p>
<p>2.6. If the customer fails to take delivery of the Goods on the date of delivery, the Company shall, without prejudice to its other rights, be entitled to store the Goods at the customer&rsquo;s risk and the customer shall pay all storage and additional carriage costs incurred.</p>
<p>2.7. Whilst every effort will be made to supply Goods in accordance with samples and/or agreed specifications the Company reserves the right to modify specifications, designs and materials where such modifications do not materially affect the quality or fitness for purpose of the Goods or to comply with any applicable standards or legal requirements.</p>
<p>2.8. Unless otherwise notified to the customer, Goods will be invoiced at the price stipulated in the Company&rsquo;s published price list current at the date of the acceptance of the order. In the case of an order for delivery by instalments each instalment shall be invoiced at the price stipulated in the Company&rsquo;s published price list at the date of despatch of such instalment. Such prices are exclusive of VAT.</p>
<p>2.9. Carriage to the customer&rsquo;s single UK address shall be charged at the rates prevailing and advised to the customer from time to time or as advised on order.

<p>2.10. Special designs of socks as well as goods printed or numbered may not be combined in value with stock items to form part of a carriage paid order. Special sock designs, printed, numbered &amp; short-sleeved garments will be subject to a separate carriage charge if those goods do not exceed the carriage paid value applicable. Special orders may yield a small excess quantity to guard against rejects in production. Such overmakes will be charged at half price.</p>
<p>2.11. Unless otherwise agreed, the Company shall invoice the Goods on or after despatch of the Goods. The Company shall be entitled to invoice each instalment as and when each instalment is despatched. Payment of all sums shall be made in sterling and is due by the last day of the month following the month of invoice unless otherwise advised. The Company may sue for any monies outstanding beyond this date even if property in any relevant Goods has not passed to the customer. Where offered, terms for taking advantage of early settlement discounts are stated on each invoice and will be tightly enforced.</p>
<p>2.12. If any payment is not made in full by the due date then, without affecting any other right which it may have, the Company may deduct any outstanding amounts from any monies owed to the customer on any account whatsoever. The Company may debit the customer with bank charges incurred by the Company for representation of any failed cheque or other failed method of payment.</p>

<p>the customer inspects the Goods on delivery and notifies the Company within three (3) days of delivery of any alleged defects, shortage in quantity or damage. If the customer fails to comply with these provisions, the Goods shall be deemed conclusively to be in accordance with the Contract and free from any defect or damage which would be apparent on a reasonable examination of them;</p>
<p>when signing for deliveries the customer must state clearly on the delivery note any damage or shortages;</p>

The policy shall bear an endorsement recording the Company&rsquo;s interest, and the customer shall promptly provide a copy of such endorsement at the Company&rsquo;s request.</li>
<li>If the customer does anything or fails to do anything which could cause it to become subject to any of the events listed in clause 4.3 or if the Company reasonably believes any such event is about to happen, then:</li>

<li>without prejudice to the equitable rules as to tracing, in the event of any resale by the customer of the Goods, the Company's beneficial entitlement shall attach to the proceeds of sale or other disposition thereof so that such proceeds or any claim therefore shall be assigned to the Company and until such assignment shall be held on trust in a separate identified account for the Company by the customer and such proceeds shall not be mingled with other monies or paid into any overdrawn bank account and shall at all times be identifiable as the Company&rsquo;s monies;</li>
</ul>
<p>4.3. The Company or any related companies shall have the right to cancel all or any contracts with the customer or withhold delivery of any Goods if:-</p>
